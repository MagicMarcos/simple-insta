<h1>How It's Made:</h1>
<p>Utilized: </p> 
    <ul> 
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>Node</li>
        <li>Express</li>
        <li>EJS</li>
        <li>CSS(flexbox & bootstrap)</li>
        <li>MongoDB</li>
    </ul>

<p>Users are able to create posts, like them and comment on them. Posts can be opened individually. Users accounts can also be browsed by guests. <p/>


<h1>Lessons Learned:</h1>
<p>Through building this app, I was able to further strengthen my abilities with CRUD applications. I also had a change to get better with bootstrap and work with some new packages such as multer to upload photos. Further more I was able to use Mongo DB as a SQL like database to make relations between documents. </p>


<h1>Optimizations</h1>
<p>As someone with no background in art, styling could definitely use improvements.</p>
<p>Some of the code needs to refactored for better readabiility. Some deprecated code (bodyparser) needs to be updated </p>
<p>Upcoming features: </p>
    <ul> 
        <li>Accessibilty features like, high contrast and zoom in options</li>
        <li>Ensuring that likes are only available to users who are logged in</li>
        <li>Adding delete features that are only avalible to users who own the post</li>
    </ul>
